- JSX syntax
- Props (passing data to components)
- State with `useState`

## 2. Component Architecture
- Nested components
- Props drilling
- Conditional rendering
- Lists and keys (using `map`)
- Event handling (`onClick`, etc.)

## 3. Hooks (Core Concepts)
- `useState` deep dive
- `useEffect` (side effects, lifecycle)
- `useRef` (DOM access & storing values)
- `useMemo` and `useCallback` basics

## 4. Forms and User Input

- `useEffect` for data fetching
- Loading and error states
- Working with APIs

## 8. State Management
- Lifting state up
- Prop drilling problem
- Context API (with `useContext`)
- Intro to third-party state libs (like Redux/Zustand â€” optional at this stage)

## 9. Custom Hooks
- Why and when to create custom hooks
- Building a custom `useLocalStorage` hook (for example)

## 10. Performance Optimization
- React rendering basics
- Memoization with `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`
- Lazy loading components (`React.lazy`, `Suspense`)

## 11. Testing (optional at this stage)
- What to test in React
- Intro to React Testing Library
- Unit vs integration testing

## 12. Deploying React Apps
- Building the project for production
- Hosting on platforms (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
